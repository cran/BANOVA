\title{Eye-movement data for analysis of print ad designs}
\description{
Data were collected in an experimental study in which 88 participants freely paged through a magazine at home or in a waiting room. While flipping through pages at their own pace, participants' eye-movements were recorded with infra-red corneal reflection eye-tracking methodology. In a subsequent memory task, participants were asked to identify the target brand in the ad as soon as possible by touching the correct brand name on the screen. \bold{Accuracy} (accurate=1, inaccurate =0) of brand memory and \bold{response time} were recorded for each ad and participant.

\usage{data(bpndata)}
\format{
  This R object contains 3080 observations in the data (35 ads x 88 participants). The goal is to examine the effects of several ad design variables on both eye movements and memory. The variables include:

1.  RESPONDENT_ID: ID number of a respondent;\cr
2.  AD_ID: ID number of an ad;\cr
3.	PAGE_NUM: page number in the magazine where an ad appears (1,2,3,...);\cr
4.	PAGE_POS: the right-side vs. left-side position on a page, 1 = right, 0 = left;\cr
5.	PIC_FIX: fixation count of the pictorial element (0, 1, 2, 3, ...);\cr
6.	PIC_SIZE: surface size of the pictorial element, in inches2;\cr
7.	RECALL_ACCU: whether a respondent accurately recalls the brand name, 1= yes, 0 = no;\cr
8.	RECALL_TIME: the time it takes a respondent to answer the brand recall question, in seconds.\cr
