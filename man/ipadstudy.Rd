\title{Data for the study of relation between Conspicuous, Brand Usage, Self-Brand Connection and attitudes toward the brand}
\description{
  The study is a between-subjects experiment which has factor (conspicuousness: low vs. high) and one measured variable (self-brand connection). The goal is to show that conspicuous brand use negatively affects attitudes toward the user and the brand only for observers low in self-brand connection. One hundred fifty-four participants were exposed to a video manipulating conspicuous brand usage. Participants completed the study by answering several questions which are used to measure the dependent (attitude) and independent (self-brand connection) variables in the model.

\format{
  This R object contains between-subjects variables: \$owner is an indicator variable. If the subject owns iPad or iPhone, then owner = 1. It is equal to 0 otherwise. \$age denotes the age of subjects. \$gender denotes the gender of subjects. gender = 1 if the subject is a female, 0 otherwise. \$conspic is an indicator variable related to conspicuousness. conspic = 1 if conspicuousness is high. \$selfbrand denotes the self-brand connection for Apple. \$id is the id of subjects. \$attitude denotes the attitudes towards the brand which is the continuous dependent variable. \$apple_dl is a seven-point scale variable which denotes the attitudes (dislike = 1,..., like = 7)
