\usage{
BANOVA.simple(BANOVA_output, base = NULL, quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975), 
dep_var_name = NULL, return_posterior_samples = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{BANOVA_output}{an object of class "BANOVA" returned by BANOVA.run function with 
an outcome of the Hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA analysis}

\item{base}{a character string which specifies the name of the mediator variable used as a base 
for calculation}

\item{quantiles}{a numeric vector with quantiles for the posterior interval of the simple effects.
Must include two elements with values between 0 and 1 in ascending order, default c(0.025, 0.975)}

\item{dep_var_name}{a character string with a name of the dependent variable, for the Multinomial model only, 
default NULL}

\item{return_posterior_samples}{logical indicator of whether samples of the posterior simple effects
distributions should be returned, default \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the summary tables of the results; optionally returns the 
samples drawn from the posterior simple effects distributions.
\item{\code{results_summary}}{a list of tables with summaries of the posterior simple effects distributions
  for all factors and their combinations that are interacting with a moderating variable.}
\item{\code{samples_simple_effects}}{if \code{return_posterior_samples} is set to \code{TRUE} 
a list of tables with samples of the posterior simple effects is returened. The tables include results
for all levels of all factors and their combinations that are interacting with a moderating variable.}
}
\description{
\code{BANOVA.simple} calculates simple or partial effects, also known as simple main effects in a
model with more than one interacting factors. One variable must be selected as a moderating (or base) 
factor. Both single-level and multi-level models with any of the distributions accommodated in the package can be analyzed.
}
\details{
The function identifies all factors and their combinations that are interacting with a moderating of "base"
variable. For each interaction, it determines all possible level combinations of the involved regressors,
which are further used to combine the posterior samples of the selected regression coefficients to calculate 
simple effects. 

When the default effect coding scheme is used the simple effects are calculated for all levels of the 
interacting variables, as specified in the data. If a user specifies different contrasts for any of the interacting 
variables the simple effects for these variables are reported for the user-defined 
regressors. This distinction is reflected in the labels of the reported results: in the default case labels from the 
original factors are displayed; in the case of user-defined contrasts, the name of the regressor is displayed instead. 

The summary of the posterior distribution of each simple effect contains the mean, 
standard deviation, posterior interval, which by default reports a central 95\% interval, 
but can also be specified by the user, and a Bayesian p-value. 

Note that for a Multinomial model intercepts and between-subject regressors have choice specific 
coefficients and thus simple effects are reported for each possible choice outcome. To perform the 
calculation for a Multinomial model an additional argument \code{dep_var_name} with a name of the 
dependent variable must be specified.
