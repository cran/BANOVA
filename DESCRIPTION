Description: BANOVA covers several Bayesian Analysis of Variance (BANOVA) models used in analysis of experimental designs in which both within- and between- subjects factors are manipulated. They can be applied to data that are common in the behavioral sciences and related fields. The package includes: Hierarchical Bayes ANOVA models with normal response, t response, Binomial(Bernoulli) response, Poisson response, ordered multinomial response and multinomial response variables. All models accommodate unobserved heterogeneity by including a normal distribution of the parameters across individuals. Outputs of the package include tables of sums of squares, effect sizes and p-values, and tables of means, which are easily interpretable for behavioral researchers. BANOVA uses JAGS as the computational platform.
